# Ontario Birth Study Dashboard 


I was tasked with displaying the OBS' progress in an exciting manner to visitors of our website. I was able to do this using R (Shiny). Two versions of the dashboard exist, a simplified version for anyone who visits the [home page](http://ontariobirthstudy.com/) and another for [prospective researchers](http://ontariobirthstudy.com/researchers/) interested in OBS Data and Specimens.
